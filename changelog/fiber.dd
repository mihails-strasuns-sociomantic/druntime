Add Fiber's stack-protection page for Posix.

The feature already existing for Windows' fiber implementation is now added to
the systems using mmap to allocate fibers' stacks: After (or before) the last
page used for the Fiber's stack, the page is allocate which is protected for
any kind of access. This will cause system to trap immediately on the fiber's
stack overflow. If in debugger session, one can inspect contents of the memory
before or after stack pointer and it can be seen if it contains END OF FIBER
string pattern.
